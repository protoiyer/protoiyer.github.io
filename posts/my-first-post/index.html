        <p>I was pondering over the last few days over having the right kind of people in a team, <em>any</em> team, including a Software Development team. It suddenly flashed in my mind that I had seen a quote attributed to Dravid somewhere on the same topic.</p>
<p>At last, I figured it out. Dravid had given a rather absorbing interview to the Cricinfo magazine that appeared in the inaugural issue (Jan 2006 issue that had Dravid on the front cover) of the magazine. This was what I was looking for:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The right people - and I hate to say it - not have the wrong people around them. <strong>You don&rsquo;t want people whose own insecurities, whose own problems and whose own fears drag everyone else down</strong>. That can be a big dampener in teams&hellip;</em></p>
<p><em>&rdquo;&hellip;If you&rsquo;re going to be spending time in the team always having to cajole and look after a few people, you&rsquo;re doing a disservice to the rest because you&rsquo;re wasting and investing too much time and energy in a few people who&rsquo;re taking away from the group. Players need to understand that they need to give energy to the unit. There are times of course when you&rsquo;re not doing well and your form&rsquo;s not good and you&rsquo;ll need the support of other people. But most of the time you&rsquo;ve got to give to the team and make sacrifices to the team and give back to the team.&quot;</em></p>
