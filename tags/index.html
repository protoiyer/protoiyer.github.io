<p>Well the time has come for an update for <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/precise/">12.04 LTS</a> that came out during the last week of April.</p>
<p>Since I had written that <a href="https://protoiyer.github.io/posts/setting-up-linux-11.04-ror/">previous post</a> in such detail, I will just jot down the steps in this one. This is more for my reference, but may be it will be of use to someone as well. Also, that post came in quite handy during the current setup and so I hope I would refer back to this one as well in future.</p>

<p>As many of you might be aware, I have been a fan of the Ruby language for a few years now, and though I had read a bit about Rails, I started learning and using it on a daily basis only during the past 8 to 10 weeks. Coming to the world of Linux from Windows has been liberating, especially for a keyboard junkie like me. Plus I just love the fact that I can invert the color of any/all window by pressing WindowsKey+N or WindowsKey+M. That is just super awesome!</p>

<p>This week Google rolled out the redesign of my favorite Google product - Google Reader. This was a much needed face-lift, no doubt – though I am not a fan of the new UI – and more importantly, from Google’s perspective, they were integrating one more service with Google+, the future of Google. This was supposed to make Reader more social, but ironically, in a perplexing move (at least, from the perspective of power users of Google Reader), Google ended up making Reader a less social, and a less useful product overall.</p>

But my good friend Subru had posted a comment that made me (as it does most of the time) take notice and do some thinking and research about the importance of study and practice in the career of programmers. I did that since it has a direct impact on the topic I have been harping about &ndash; the talent of the programmers like me, or the lack of it.</p>
