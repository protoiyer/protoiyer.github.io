      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Software development productivity would skyrocket if the least effective 30% were fired tomorrow&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://memeagora.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Neal Ford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was in the December of 2005 that I first wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;http://protoiyer.github.io/posts/becoming-a-better-programmer/&#34;&gt;how to be a better programmer&lt;/a&gt;. At that time I was into my fifth year as a programmer, and though I wanted to write what I am writing today, I decided to narrow down my scope to non-technical issues. I wrote about code readability and code maintainability that day. As important as these issues were (are), I guess there is a larger issue that must be addressed &amp;ndash; the technical skill set of the programmers. Then I wrote about (nay, linked to) the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.removingalldoubt.com/permalink.aspx/a32977e2-cb7d-42ea-9d25-5e539423affd&#34;&gt;fatherly advice to new programmers&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20061017124921/http://www.removingalldoubt.com/permalink.aspx/a32977e2-cb7d-42ea-9d25-5e539423affd&#34;&gt;web archive link&lt;/a&gt;) by Chuck Jazdzewski.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been working as a programmer for a little over 5 years now, and it was with great interest that I read the article &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/software_professionalism.html&#34;&gt;What is a Professional Programmer&lt;/a&gt;, written by Sarah George, and hosted at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.developerdotstar.com/&#34;&gt;DeveloperDotStar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles_top.html&#34;&gt;Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I can say that I have been on the right path so far when I evaluate myself on the various parameters she has mentioned, viz., trustworthiness, teamwork, leadership, communication, constant updating of skills, an interest in minimizing risks and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
